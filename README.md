# 🌟 `stemday_2025` Project README (Admin-Only)

Welcome to the **CCRI CyberKnights STEM Day VM Project!** 🎉
This repository powers a custom **Parrot Linux Capture The Flag (CTF)** experience designed for high school students.

👥 **This repository is for CCRI CyberKnights club members only.**
It contains all source files, admin tools, and scripts used to **build and maintain** the student-facing version of the CTF.

📝 **If you’re preparing the VM for students:**
The *student version* includes only the **essential challenge files and launcher**, without admin tools or developer resources. That bundle is auto-generated by our tools and placed in the VM’s `Desktop` folder.

To download Parrot Linux for testing: [https://www.parrotsec.org/download/](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/)
The student VM uses the **Home Edition**, but you can test with the full **Security Edition** as well—it’s essentially a more advanced Kali Linux.

## 🚀 Preparing the Student VM

To build and distribute the student-facing CTF experience:

1. Use the **admin tools** in this repository to generate the student bundle:

   ```bash
   cd stemday_2025/web_version_admin/create_website
   ./build_web_version.py
   ```

   This obfuscates the flags and builds the student web portal in `stemday_2025/web_version/`.

2. Copy the **`stemday_2025/` folder** and the **`Launch CCRI CTF Hub.desktop`** shortcut to the **Desktop** of the student VM.

3. On the student VM desktop:

   * Right-click **Launch CCRI CTF Hub.desktop** → **Properties → Permissions**
   * ✅ Check *“Allow this file to run as a program”*

   This shortcut launches the student hub in a browser.

---

## 🛠 Admin Workflow (Quick Reference)

* **Build student hub (web portal):**

  ```bash
  cd stemday_2025/web_version_admin/create_website
  ./build_web_version.py
  ```

* **Test in folder mode and web portal mode** before distributing.

* Keep student-only bundles **separate from admin tools**.

## 🙌 Club Member Guidelines

✅ Keep admin-only flags and tools **out of `web_version/`**  
✅ Test all scripts thoroughly before release  
✅ Use relative paths for portability  
✅ Don’t commit `.pyc` files or student-only builds
