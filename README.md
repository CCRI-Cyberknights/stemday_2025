## 🚀 What is this?

This is a self-contained cybersecurity challenge environment.  
- No internet required — everything runs locally in your VM.  
- You’ll explore tools, solve puzzles, and uncover hidden flags.  
- Each challenge includes an explanation of **how the tools work**, **why you’re using them**, and **what’s happening under the hood**.  

This version is built for **students**, with no admin or developer-only tools included.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Here’s how the files are organized on your VM’s Desktop:  

```
Desktop/
├── CCRI_CTF_Home/                # Main CTF folder
│   ├── challenges/               # All the hands-on CTF challenges
│   ├── web_version/              # The hub website for browsing challenges
│   ├── Launch CCRI CTF Hub.desktop  # Shortcut to open the hub in a browser
└── (no admin scripts or hidden flags)
```

📝 **Important:**  
- The `web_version/` folder contains the interactive CTF hub.
