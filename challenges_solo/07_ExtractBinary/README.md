# 🧵 Challenge 07: Extract from Binary

**Mission Briefing:**
A suspicious binary executable (`hidden_flag`) was recovered from a compromised system.
Analysts believe it contains critical intelligence, but the data is buried deep within the compiled code, surrounded by thousands of lines of "garbage" data and decoy strings.

## 🧠 Intelligence Report
* **The Concept:** **Binaries** are compiled programs (0s and 1s). However, they often contain "hardcoded strings"—plain text messages, variable names, or passwords—stored directly inside the file.
* **The Lock:** The file is not a text file. Opening it in a standard editor will just show random symbols.
* **The Strategy:** **String Extraction**. We need a tool that ignores the binary machine code and prints only the sequences of human-readable characters.

## 📝 Investigator’s Journal
*Notes from the field:*

> "They buried the message deep. I tried running the program, but it just crashed.
>
> I know the flag is in there, but it's hidden amongst a mountain of random junk and fake markers. They even threw in some decoy flags to throw us off. You need to pull out *everything* readable and then filter aggressively for the pattern we care about (`CCRI-`)."

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

This is a classic static analysis task.

| Tool | Purpose | Usage Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **strings** | The gold standard. Scans binary files for printable characters. | `strings hidden_flag` |
| **grep** | Filters output to find specific patterns. | `strings hidden_flag \| grep "CCRI-"` |
| **xxd** | Views the file as a Hex Dump (good for seeing context). | `xxd hidden_flag \| less` |

> 💡 **Tip:** The `strings` command outputs *a lot* of noise. You almost always want to pipe (`|`) it into `grep` to find exactly what you are looking for.

## 🏁 Flag Format
**`CCRI-AAAA-1111`**

Extract the strings, filter the noise, and identify the true flag.
