# 🧠 Challenge 09: Fix the Flag!

You’ve found a Python script that’s supposed to reveal the agency’s flag — but it’s broken!

Instead of showing the correct flag, it prints the wrong number at the end. Your task is to debug and repair the code so the full flag is revealed.

## 🧠 What’s Going On?

Even small mistakes in code can have big consequences. This script has a bug that causes it to calculate the wrong value. You'll need to identify the issue and fix it like a proper developer would.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

Here are some common tools you can use while debugging Python scripts:

| Tool/Command     | Purpose                                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `nano` / `vim`   | Edit the Python script in the terminal              |
| `python`         | Run the script and see what it prints               |
| `print()`        | Add extra output to help debug variable values      |
| `int()` / `f""`  | Convert values and format output cleanly            |

> 💡 Pay special attention to how the code performs calculations.

## 📝 Challenge Instructions

1. Open `broken_flag.py` and carefully review the code.  
2. Look for logic or math errors in how the final number is calculated.  
3. Correct the mistake and re-run the script.  
4. When the correct flag appears in your terminal, save it like this:

```
echo "CCRI-AAAA-1111" > flag.txt
```

* `broken_flag.py` – The buggy Python script that needs fixing.

## 🏁 Flag Format

The flag will appear like this when correct:

**CCRI-AAAA-1111**

Replace `AAAA` and the numbers with the real flag you discover.

Think like a coder. Follow the flow of logic. One wrong operator is all that stands between you and the flag!
