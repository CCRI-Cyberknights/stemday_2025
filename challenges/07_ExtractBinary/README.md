# ⚙️ Binary Extraction Challenge

You have recovered a compiled binary file named `hidden_flag`.

Computers read binary code, but humans cannot. However, programmers often leave plain text strings inside compiled programs (like error messages, variables, or secret keys).

**Your Mission:** Perform **Static Analysis**.
1.  The file is not executable or readable by a standard text editor.
2.  Use the provided tools (like the `strings` command) to sift through the binary data.
3.  Look for any human-readable text that matches the flag format.
