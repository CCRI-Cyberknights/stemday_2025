# 🔐 ROT13 Decode Challenge

**Mission Briefing:**
An intercepted note was found in the logs of a compromised account. It is readable… sort of. Every letter seems shifted, as if the alphabet has been rotated.

Our analysts have identified this as **ROT13**, a classic substitution cipher that shifts every letter exactly 13 places in the alphabet.
* 🔄 **Symmetrical:** Applying ROT13 twice restores the original text.
* 🕵️‍♂️ **Obfuscation:** It is not secure encryption, but it is often used to hide spoilers or text from a casual glance.

**Your Goal:** Use the provided tools to "rotate" the text back to its original state and find the flag.
