# 🧩 Vigenère Cipher Challenge

You have recovered a scrambled message (`cipher.txt`) from an intercepted communication. Analysts suspect it was encoded using the **Vigenère cipher**.

Unlike simple rotation ciphers, Vigenère uses a **keyword** to shift letters differently throughout the message. To break it, you need to know (or guess) that keyword.

## 🔐 The Clue
**Hint:** What is the opposite of `logout`?
👉 Use that word as your keyword when running the decryption tools.
