# 📱 QR Code Puzzle

You have recovered a set of QR (Quick Response) codes.
QR codes are just a visual way of encoding text data. One of these images contains the agency flag; the others are decoys or broken links.

**Your Mission:** Decode the images.
1.  You do not need a phone. Use the provided command-line tools to "scan" the image files directly.
2.  Check each image (`qr_01.png` through `qr_05.png`).
3.  Find the one that decodes to a valid flag.

## 📂 Files in this folder
* `qr_01.png` to `qr_05.png` – Image files containing QR codes.
