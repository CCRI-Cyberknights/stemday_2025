# 🛰️ **Challenge 18: Pcap Search**

CryptKeeper operatives have been transmitting data across their internal network. You’ve intercepted a packet capture file (`traffic.pcap`) that may contain a hidden agency flag.

🎯 **Your Mission:**

⚠️ **Not every candidate is correct:**

* Four decoy flags are embedded in the traffic to confuse investigators.
* Only **one flag** matches the official CCRI format:

  ✅ **CCRI-AAAA-1111**

💡 **Tip:** Look carefully at the flag format. The real flag starts with `CCRI-`. The others are clever fakes!

📂 **Files Provided:**
• `traffic.pcap` → Captured network traffic

---

🚀 **Objective:** Identify the correct flag and submit it to the scoreboard.
