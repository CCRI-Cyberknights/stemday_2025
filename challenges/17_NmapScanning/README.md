🛰️ Challenge 17: Nmap Scan Puzzle
==================================

Several simulated services are running locally on this system.  
Your mission is to uncover the **REAL flag** hidden among them.

⚠️ **Not every open port contains a flag:**  
- Some return random junk text (e.g., error pages, developer APIs).  
- Four ports return **decoy flags** with slightly wrong formats.  
- Only **one port** contains the real flag in this format:  

   ✅ **CCRI-AAAA-1111**

💡 **Tip:** Pay close attention to the format of each flag. Only one matches the official CCRI style.

🚀 **Objective:** Find the correct flag and paste it into the scoreboard.
