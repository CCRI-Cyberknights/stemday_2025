# 🐛 Broken Script Challenge

You have obtained a Python script (`broken_flag.py`) that generates the flag.
However, the script was damaged during the download. When you try to run it, it crashes.

**Your Mission:** Debug the code.
1.  Attempt to run the script to see the error message.
2.  Read the error output—it will tell you exactly where the problem is (look for `SyntaxError`).
3.  Open the file, fix the broken line, and run it again to reveal the flag.
