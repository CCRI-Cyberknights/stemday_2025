# 🕵️ Hidden File Hunt

The flag is hidden somewhere inside the `junk/` directory.
However, the directory is filled with decoy folders, fake archives, and system backups.

Furthermore, the file might be a **Hidden File** (a file starting with a `.`, which is invisible to normal `ls` commands).

**Your Mission:** Master the terminal.
1.  Navigate through the `junk` directory structure.
2.  Use commands that reveal hidden files (like `ls -a`).
3.  Alternatively, use recursive search tools (like `grep -r`) to find the text of the flag inside the files without opening them one by one.
