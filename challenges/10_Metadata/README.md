# 📷 Metadata Explorer

You have intercepted an image: `capybara.jpg`.
Visually, it is just a picture of a cute animal. But digital files contain "data about data," known as **Metadata**.

Metadata can include the camera model, GPS coordinates, timestamps, or hidden comments added by the creator.

**Your Mission:** Extract the metadata.
1.  Use the provided forensic tools (like `exiftool`) to view the hidden header information of the image.
2.  Scan the output for any fields that look like a flag.
