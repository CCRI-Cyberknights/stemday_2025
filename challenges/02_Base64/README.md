# 🧩 Base64 Decode Challenge

**📡 Intercepted Transmission**
An encoded message has been intercepted from a compromised system. The file `encoded.txt` contains data that has been obfuscated using **Base64**.

Base64 is a common encoding scheme designed to transport binary data across text-only channels.

## 🔧 The Challenge
**Base64 is not encryption.** It is just a way of representing data. Anyone with the right tool can reverse it to reveal the original message.

**Your Goal:** Use the available tools to decode the file and find the flag hidden within the noise.
