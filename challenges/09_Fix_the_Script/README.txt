# 🧠 Challenge 09: Fix the Flag! (Bash Edition)

You’ve discovered a broken Bash script that’s supposed to print the agency’s flag — but something’s gone wrong.

Right now it only prints a two-digit number at the end instead of a full flag. Your mission is to analyze the buggy code and fix it so the correct flag appears.

## 🧠 What’s Going On?

This challenge tests your ability to read and debug Bash scripts. Small mistakes in logic or syntax can break programs in subtle ways. Fixing them requires understanding how the code flows.

---

## 🛠 Tools You Might Use

- nano/vim – Edit and correct the Bash script.  
- bash – Run the script to test your fixes.  
- echo/set -x – Add debug statements to see what’s happening inside the script.

## 📝 Challenge Instructions

1. Open broken_flag.sh and read through the code carefully.  
2. Look for any logic errors, typos, or incorrect calculations.  
3. Fix the script so it correctly prints the flag in the terminal.  
4. When you see the flag on screen, save it:

echo "CCRI-AAAA-1111" > flag.txt

This challenge is about thinking like a developer and using Bash to debug and repair broken logic.
